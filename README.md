## 🖐️ Hello, I'm Manuela

After a few years of working in commerce, I felt it was time to reach for something new. I began an adventure with testing and I am looking for a place where I could develop my skills in the IT industry as a manual tester.

### 🛠️ Tools what I use:

- &nbsp; Jira, TestRail, Zephyr
- &nbsp; HTML, CSS
- &nbsp; Visual Studio Code
- &nbsp; Trello board
- &nbsp; MS Word, MS Excel
